The text explores the physics behind fire and flames. It explains that the color of a flame depends on the purity of the fuel and whether it burns cleanly or not. When fuel burns cleanly, like with gas flames or candle wicks, the heat excites molecules to release light in the form of blue radiation due to quantum mechanics. However, when fuel is impure or doesn't burn entirely, like with wood or coal fires, the blue light is overpowered by light from particles of soot and smoke, which glow red hot.

The text also explains that all objects emit light through black body radiation, depending on their temperature. This is why hot objects like lava, iron, and flames glow with a familiar red-orange light. The reason flames take on a tongue-like shape is due to gravity, as the Earth's pole causes hot air to rise and shape the flame. In zero-gravity environments, flames would spread outwards in all directions without being influenced by the Earth's pull.
